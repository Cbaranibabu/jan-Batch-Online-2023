        <p>Production system is basically a conversion system where the raw materials are converted into 
            useful or marketable products.it is created to accomplish specific objectives.it consists of
            numerous sub-component or sub-systems all of which interact is persuing the objectives. 
            The efficiency of production system is stated in terms of its ability to produce the 
            products with required quantity and specified quality at pre determined cost and predetermined time.

        <h3 id="Objectives of ppc">Objectives of ppc</h3>
        <p>To design a production system to meet due date consistent with minimum cost and quality
            standard.To systematically plan the production activities to acheive the high production 
            efficiency.To decide the nature and magnitude of different input factors to produce the output.
            To ensure maximum utilization of all resources.To ensure production of quality products.

        <p>
            Production planning involves management decision relating to how much to produce what 
            materials parts and tools will be required what steps should be completed and how much 
            work is to  be done by each workstation.Production planning is a pre production activity
            it is the pre determination of manufacturing requirements such as manpower materials 
            machines and manufacturing process.<a href="#Production planning">Go to top</a>

        <h3 id="Production CONTROL">Production control</h3>
        <p>Production control through control mechanism tries to take corrective action to match the
            planned and actual production .Thus production control reviews the progress of work and takes
            corrective steps in order to ensure that programmed production take place.the production 
            control involves implementation of production plans by coordinating different activities.

        <h3 id="Functions of production planning and control">Functions of production planning and control</h3>
        <p>Production planning and control function essentially consist of production planning
            in a manufacturing organisation before actual production activities start and excercising
           control activities to ensure that the pklanned production is realised in terms of quantity
           quality delivery schedule and the cost of production.
